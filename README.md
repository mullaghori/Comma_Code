# Comma_Code
It is a practice project for python beginners. 

Say you have a list value like this:
```
spam = ['apples', 'bananas', 'tofu', 'cats'] 
```

***ðŸ‘‰ No.1 Write a function that takes a list value is an argument and returns a string with all the items separated by a `comma` and a `space` with `and` inserted before the last item.***

*FOR EXAMPLE: Passing the previous spam list to the function would return;*
```
'apples, bananas, tofu, and cats'
```
**But your function should be able to work with `any list value` passed to it.**
